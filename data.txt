If you've watched the Qualifier 1 between Gujarat Titans and Rajasthan Royals, you probably know that Killer Miller had given a message to the bowlers 🌝
(I may have phrased the title incorrectly).
It was 9th grade. Biology class.
Ma'am (who was the beauty with brained crush of almost all boys) gave us some questions she made that required knowledge about our local region. (I know, it was the environmental science part of biology).
The prize was a hug and a chocolate from her One question I cannot remember was of the following type, but much more complex :

Which part of our city should you clean in a time period of few days that will affect the healthy of hundreds of citizens positively ?

I remember asking that question anonymously on quora (the good ol' days when we could) and writing an answer after an hour or something when re-attempting it.

>>>>>Fast forward next day>>>>>

I could see the young lady entering the class as the picturesque imageries entered my mind.

She asked if anyone had solved all of em'.

And noone did 😃😌 except me…

WRONG;

That time, most of the students did the homework to my surprise.

And then ma'am asked some students to loudly tell the answers in cloud. One student, one question. I was told not to answer till end but I interrupted at times because they were MY ANSWERS which I made public -_-.

Finally, my turn came and I had to explain to ma'am that these are my answers which I wrote on the internet. It was believable because the sharma ji ka beta in our class did hw for the first time and he couldn't even read his answer inducing laughter in the class (karma bichh !).

I went to ma'am, asked for her hand, she gave it to me. (hand = phone here).

I showed her my quora answers and guess who stole the spotlight ?
My first week in dbmk !

Gimme suggestions for 'Bihari Men!’

Naman Yadav ( नमन यादव ) Server me vapas kaise aau?

When my time comes, of course 😁

Until then, All the Best to all the 12thers.

Have a good day :)

So, I going to convey this answer to you very innocently and sincerely.

Hope so, it would be almost True in the future.

• I want ability to make right choices. As life is full of choices. Yes just right choice.

You could be thinking why choices?

So, here's the answer.

I am a class 9 student and though, when I'll enter class 11 then I've to choose the right path and make a clear decision or choice for my future dream.

Right choice will also give a right knowledge about a content to you.

After that when then the dream of lawyer will come true than I've to also make right decisions for my own and others life.

Choice for Money. Yes, this is that how many ways will be there to approach money.

Thisisthatsocalledsecondbusiness.

And, though by reading this all you'll know the power of making choices is the most powerful power ever.

Here and there alright and all money hither and thither.
Leaving. Till than handle this 'BYE’
This seems like an interesting question .

So , a nice wintery morning I wake up and come out of my house and see this


At first I would be horrified . I would shorten my breaths to suppress nausea . Then I would observe my surroundings to make sure that anyone suspicious isn't near . Then after that run back inside the house and get a weopon sort of thing in case I am ambushed .

After that I would slowly approach the skull .land determine the cause of death . Although I am no professional but we can get a general idea by just looking ,, like whether he was killed by smashing , slicing , mincing etc. I wouldn't touch the skull though . Simply I wouldn't disturb the arrangement otherwise I might get in trouble if it gets used against me

I would call police .

In this duration I might vomit due to the smell. Though I know it's just blood , no big deal; but still I am not used to the smell .

So that's all

Celebrating countless years of cannibalism

So, this will be my last post. Posting on Quora was FUN! I am surely gonna miss it!!
some of them are here:- (#all of them are self made)

The difference between you and other girls is I don’t love them..
Only one thing in this world is more beautiful than you………. MY LOVE for you..
My Love for you is like wind you can’t see it but it exists
Do you know what is the difference between you and moon …… moon arrives only in night…
You are my rose but I will never pluck you

First half = 3 Exams (PT-1, PT-2, Half-Yearly) Second Half = Daily Flip Test, Weekly Revision Test, Parent won't let you outside, 4 Exams (Pt-3, PT-4, PT-5, Annual Exam), and last but not the least, Depression and Anxiety
Ok so guys I am writing the space because first I don’t want to be kicked out as a Contributor again and also sadly the space views and the upvote ratio of posts is going down and taking very heavy hits despite the board are the verge of ending really. The lockdown removal and return to normalcy which is great is hitting the space very abnormally like no other space I follow and post content.

So, today while travelling back home from Aakash, I found out this post:-

Like from Youhaveloast Chinki post and even then Bhaiyuu gang figured out that you are talking about Neni and now instead of targeting indirectly or blurring names, the names are getting closer to actual real names. I don’t believe that this Indirect direct approach will help our cause and help us curb the behavior in reality and the content and covering material is so much that multiple posts are made to cover up everything though I check Discord once in a while so can’t connect to it.

It can also backfire and might help gain followers to the guy targeted. It is way better option to ignore. Also, we are looking like we are shouting on a wall because Bunkmasters is aloof to all our targeting and stuff of their top brass and I guess for the deeds of their top brass, we shouldn’t call a space fully cringy and target it given they aren’t participating directly in conflict. Most of the guys posting there aren’t on Discord, so I guess focus on main goal and the subject at hand rather than getting distracted.

Now, after roasting my space members for wrong approach, the move is clever to use new or less recognized space members for making Bhaiyuu and Prey posts since if they target and retaliate which will of course happen, we can make it look like they are suppressing voice of Small and new Quorans though no much real consequences because BNBR is now very weak and hypocritical. Special mention to Bhaiyuu gang aka Bunkmasters top brass for adding Ghee to the fire. Ghee is expensive, give it to me.

You know DBMK are actually on the right in this matter and one mistake of yours has led to serious leaks, defamation and exposes. I feel that a ceasefire can happen only when Bunkmasters stop whatever has been exposed in Bhaiyuu and Prey posts. Also, this controversy is nothing just a content giver to our content lacking space and why are we really bringing Discord on Quora? Like there is no feeling and all of a controversy or fight until there are posts from everyone in memes and written posts regarding it or as K Pop controversy, people putting up accounts for mass reporting. I guess this controversy should be resolved and dead as soon as possible. Won’t tag anyone else. I don’t think it will cross one upvote without clickbait, so here it is:-


Also, if anyone even the top brass of DBMK thinks we can outright win, it ain’t possible. Bunkmasters space is just 600 behind us in followers and Saahil has followers exclusive of that even though his Grammar and Spelling leaves a lot to be desired really though I won’t like pointing it out and shaming him for it again and again. If you want direct confrontations with them directly, resolve it on Discord giving choicest of abuse and when tired, call for end of controversy. First it isn’t giving Dank memes and most boring and cold one ever seen in history of space.

Now, my clickbait pic though might seem unrelated is related in ironic way. “Dil Sambhal Ja Zaara” Parody is quiet true for our space. Everything is shrinking, followers have stopped looking at the space and the amount of posts once upon a time in an hour now are content of whole day which not much change in content or even some fall of it. A Event which I and /msfconsole along with others, all gave up and now I won’t go against the space much since I got what I wanted. The good old post of Contributor here. But seeing the condition of the space, a event and that too a big one that can inject adernaline and rejuvenate the space is required. Hope Moderators and Admins look into it rather than demoting me which has high chances.

I hope mere iss hafte ka Quota cover ho gaya though I will post more if I get time. I don’t have that many stories to tell. I have shared as much as I can though will look for anything remaining. Really all of my non cricket stories, Crush affair, my alternate universe with her, shattered hopes and everything else is given to the space along with random shit posting .

Thank You
A boy with 200+ followers on quora and he is a moderator in a big space.

Prey ki ek bestie hai “chimki” Woh uske taraf bohot jyada possessive hai kisi se bhi lad jata hai uske liye chahe uski bestie usko pagal bana rhi ho.aur prey ke kehne par chimki kisi se bhi dosti tod deti hai. Aseem pyaar ka example😂

Translation :- Prey has a bestie we'll call her chimki , he is very much possessive towards his bestie and for her he fights with anyone without thinking for a while even if she (his bestie) is doing a prank on him and because of prey , chimki breaks friendship with others.what a love.

.

Woh ek gang ka member hai jiska naam hai “Bhaiyuuu gang” Aur uss gang ka kaam hai ki har uss post pr harassment ka report maarna jismein unke barrey mein idhar udhar ka likha ho mai bhi bohot sure ki iss post pr bhi bhar ke reports ayegi koi nhi next post mein dekhte hai unko aaram se.

Translation:- he is a member of a gang named “Bhaiyuu gang” And their work is to report every post in which they are targeted or exposed just like my last post and I'm damn sure that even in this post I'll get many unnecessary report. No problem I'll see them in my next post.



So many fake reports with the same reason (Harassment)

.

16 ka londa Indirectly bol rha hai ki woh mera baap hai sale ko itna nhi pta ki bkl woh 16 ka hai mai 14 yrs ka iska mtlb mai jab paida hua woh 2 saal ka tha toh 2 saal ki umar mein kon baap banta hai.

Translation:- He is of 16 yrs Even that he indirectly said that he is my father that shit doesn't knows maths coz When he was 2yrs old I was born and who the fuck becomes a father at the age of 2.


.

Usko adat hai sorry bolne ki sala hazar kaand krta aur hazar sorry bolta pta nhi kya maja ata hai

Translation:- He has hobby of apologizing others because of his mischievous behavior I don't know what's wrong with him.


.

Sale ko gali ati hai lekin sirf ek “Bsdk” Aur kuch nhi bolta sala

Translation:- He abuses but he knows only 1 slang “Bsdk” None other than this.

.

servers me publically kehta ki school me harr dusre din proposals aate lekin jab shakal dekho aisi ki r/eyeblech bhi reject krde

Translation:- He always says that he gets proposals every day at school but when you see his face even r/eyeblech will reject him.

No offense only facts.

Be like him if you wanted to get roasted in other servers .

Next post:- The bhaiyuu gang

Sorry for any typos or grammatical mistakes.

And stop reporting unnecessarily

Will meet you in the next post.
Mirror , mirror, on the wall who’s the cringiest of them all?


Like legit, guys, she’s got the crown.

Not only has she created a bunch of cringe stereotypes about how “teenagers” live, she’s also not even 13 yet.

I’m sorry, sis , but you have confused your million sub count for your age.


Thanks for listening to my rant about this cringefest
One who loves you till you close your eyes is a, “Mother” and one who loves you without an expression in there eyes is a, “Father”.

Mother introduces you to the world. Father introduces the world to you.

Mother gives you life, while Father gives you living.

Mother makes sure you're not starving, while Father makes sure you're knowing the value of starving.

Mother personifies care, while Father personifies responsibilities.

Mother protects you from a fall, while Father Teaches you to get up from a fall.

Mother teaches you walking, while Father teaches you the walk of life.

Mother teaches from her own experiences, while Father teaches you to learn from your own experiences.

Mother reflects ideology, while Father reflects reality.

Mother's Love is known to you from your birth, while Father's Love is known when you come to your own responsibilities.

Both are totally equal. Just some things aren't seen and sured.

Enjoy what your father says.

And keep loving your mother.

So this is from 4th class, there was a girl named Kavya (name changed for privacy reasons, her real name was also kavya), she was most probably mentally ill. This story will have two parts:-
Confirmed (which happened in front of me)
Unconfirmed (which might just be a rumor)

So due to her 3 teachers left or were fired from school and I am not even kidding and made many cry and made my friends section changed

She used to steal things, one day she was caught stealing pencils in camera.
There was our science teacher who had migrane and she left school due to her
There was miss shivani or miss shivangi who was or Hindi teacher, she also left the school due to her.
There was Amit sir who got fired because kavya was disturbing the class and he pushed her and she complained to principal.
My friend parth one day fought with her and she ripped off his shirt and his section was changed.
Her section was changed alot of time but she came back In my class wtf.
Here is a weird one, she used to spit in notebooks which we all thought was the pipe leaking 😂
She used to steal people's notebooks (including mine) especially in maths class. She even made teacher cry.
(Unconfirmed) some say she even slapped principal
Usko bahut galiyaa padti thi
She showed middle fingers everytime. (It was very bad that time)
(Unconfirmed) her family had a case with our school.
Finally one week she didn't come to school and we got to know she left or most probably resticated. 🥱
I am writing this cuz in our last day before holidays we were discussing this and I felt ngl.

I probably add more if I remember something.
was watching AIB video
for the Nth time

saw this subtle joke
The worst thing about living in a place like Delhi is that one day you sleep feeling hot and the next morning you're in Antarctica 🤧

Quora makes me awe. We are all so different, yet the same. Quora is one platform that can unite people from all corners of the world to do one thing. I call it “having fun”, but my friends might call it “bhakchodi”. Neither of us are wrong though.

We all share knowledge, discuss our views on various topics, and get to know each other. I am a happy-go-lucky extrovert (unless I am sad, of course, 😂) and I love conversing with people. Quora helps me to do that fairly easily.

In addition to that, Quora is one of the few places where you can write without hesitation. Apart from procrastination, my favorite hobby is writing. Who knows, Quora might end up catapulting me into stardom.

Not only that, I have become tired of sharing my photos on Instagram and Whatsapp. Quora offers me a new audience, although I have very few readers. Let me share one more pic of mine. I know dude, nobody cares, but I am gonna do what makes me happy :)


Last but not the least, I ended up meeting some really awesome people here! Suraj Nair was one of them. His calm attitude inspires me to be more tolerant toward bullshit. Aside from that, I ended up becoming a part of this awesome place Damn #Bete Mauj Kardi where everyone is like family (imagine me saying this in Vin Diesel’s voice). I also met my first college friend and one of my best friends, Dev Jain here.

I have not mentioned some REALLY unforgettable experiences I had here. This is because my college friends will not spare the rod if my answers inadvertently come in their feed 😂

Did I mention that I also follow the meme spaces here? They share pretty good memes actually, but still don’t make Quora as addictive as Reddit. Imagine people going to “Quora rehabs” 😂

Btw, I keep my DM’s ALWAYS open. So rather than hesitating, just text me, dude. You can always block me afterward if my opinions/interests do not align with yours.

Pro tip: Following me is free of cost but comes with some exclusive perks like getting to read my newest answers before the others can😅.

Upvotes and comments are always welcome.
ONE SIDED LOVE:

Yaad hai mujhe abhi bhi woh din,

Jab hum dono mile the pehli baar,

Tumne kaha tha, “you look like a dustbin”,

Aur mujhe tumse ho gaya tha pyaar

Hmm…hmm…na na na na na

Hmm…hmm…ha ha ha ha ha

Tumne aankhon se kiya aisa jaadoo,

Ki dil Mera, ye ho gaya bekaboo,

Socha tha tumse maangunga tumhaara haath,

Lekin fatt jaati thi meri, karne mai tumse baat

Tum aur mai hum lag sakte the very cute,

Par ignore maarti thi tum, oh you were very rude,

Fir bhi mujhe kaga tum kar rahi ho is hamara,

Paagal tha mai, aur akkal ka maara.

Hmm…hmm ha ha ha ha ha

Hmm…hmm na na na na na
Today I was walking down the road. I saw a green parrot happily flying happily in the air. But then, it saw me and started flying aggressively towards me. I froze at the spot. But for a moment only. I leapt into an confectionery shop. The parrot smashed the glass,wounding himself. I too was harmed by the shards. I ran out of the shop but the parrot kept saying

“Copyright infringement!!, Copyright infringement!!”

I reached my home, bleeding. I saw a news on republic TV.


The parrot above the G in green gold productions has escaped from the building saying “gotta catch that bastard!!”

Since then I have been getting threat letters and angry parrots from the productions

A lot of people jump into relationships and find themselves in a bad place. Actually very few people ask themselves this question,

“ Why do i want to be in a relationship ? “

And

“ What are the things i am enjoying now that i won't be able to get when i will be with someone ? “

See the grass is always greener on the other side. But i am gonna try to write some real plus points of being single. ( From a guy's perspective )

# You will have lesser time for yourself when you are with someone. You can discuss all day how you are gonna manage time but lemme tell you, it ain't happening man. Being single provides you with all the time to focus on one person, Y O U !

# When you are single, you are the person responsible for your happines and for your sadness. You will be happy if something good happens to you and vice versa. When you are in relationship, her happiness is yoir happiness and her sadness means you are sad too.

# You can crack feminism jokes without caring for anybody. But if you are in a relationship and she happens to be a feminist, you better shut ur mouth up misogynist.😛

# You will be closer to your family when you are single. And that is a fact.

# You won't be losing so much time and patience choosing what to gift on her birthday. And if by mistake, you ask suggestions from ur friends, they are gonna pull ur leg all the time (Harami dost).

# You will avoid telling a lie at lot of instances. When you are in a relationship, you are gonna have to lie a lot, not to ur gf, but to other people.. ur parents, ur friends, ur teachers. So if you are not good at lying, better be single mf.

# MOST IMPORTANT.

You will get a good night sleep if u r single. You won't be talking to someone till 4 in the morning when you have to wake up at 8. Ironically it is the most underrated point.

# You won't be satisfied with ur achievements and will always thrive for more when you are single. A lot of people who come in relationship tend to get very satisfied with themselves. They become soft and fragile. There's always someone pampering them and telling that they are okay the way they are.

# You will have lesser chances of ending up like Will Smith and Johnny Depp. -_-

# You can stalk whoever you find attractive. 😛

# You can lecture ur friends who are in relationship when their relationship is having some issues and they discuss it with you. Otherwise they will say,

“ Bhai teri khud ki to sahi chl ni rhi setting mjhe kyu gyaan baant rha hai “🤐😗.

# When you are single, You will have a lot of time reading great answers on quora ( like this one ) and you will have that extra second to upvote and comment on the answer ( because no one's in ur dm waiting for ur reply ).🙃

In the end, i would say,


Kudos to all those who don't settle for less.

And online hooting for those who message their friends, “ bhai plzz koi patvade “😗.
Mhmm … 🤔Let’s see ..

By the time I complete my graduation , I’ll already be 24/25 .But that won’t be enough !? What about PG? Even If we keep that aside for a while , Keeping in mind the records with which I have embarrassed myself infront of the guys I like … I don’t think I’d be able to have a “successful relationship “ for a longer time .

So love marriage rules out right here . But just in case it happens so …

The guy is prolly going to regret marrying , atleast after a month . Why ? He’ll eventually know I’m not as “sassy or FUN” as I try to be . (Sare rehearsed batoon ki pol khul jaegi ). How long am I gonna pretend ?

I mean if he marries me thinking I was some cool bitch , well that’s gonna suck . However the fact that it was “ love marriage”, is not gonna leave him with any other option , but to put up with me ?! Trying to Divorce will be quite tedious here . Emotional breakdown will be at its peak . Dukh hi dukh hoga .

Now , let’s talk about “arranged marriage” . Primarily finding a perfect guy is going to take a major chunk of my youth ,with all the expectations and kundali matching .. ugh! I’ll atleast be 27 by then . Tabtak toh sare cute ladke shadi shuda honge 😓.

Now , here comes the trouble, arranged marriage mein ek toh ek dusre ka naam , khana , pina , pasand jante hue 2 saal nikl jaenge.

2 years will pass by just to get to know the person

Then , the fire with which we thought we were gonna start a new life together , woh toh bujh gayi hogi tab tak .

Idk about him , but me ; I’m quite impatient when it comes to these situations .

Pyaar toh pehle bhi nhi tha toh ab kese hoga ? So , even if we end up divorcing , I don’t think we both would be devastated. It would be comparatively easier to move on .

So acc to the conclusions made above ; (with regards to what is gonna follow up )

Arranged >> Love

Bring out some argumentative sentiments.😗
Infinite money or diamonds cheatcode 😁 Well, to be honest, I would rather use the cheat code to “skip this problem?” Cheat code. Like, aren't there some cheat codes which help you skip levels of a game which you couldn't clear? Good day :)
The ego is the one that says I, 
while the Soul is a Divine Power that is in you and me. 
They are completely different from each other. 
Some people believe them to be the same. 
This is not true. 
It is the ego that steals from us the realization that we are the Soul. 
Where there is the ego, there can be no Soul, where there is the Soul there will be no ego. 
Therefore, in a way they are two sides of the same coin but they are not the same. 
Are the two sides of the same coin the same? Never. When you see one side, the other side disappears. 
So it is with the Soul and ego. When there is the Soul, the ego will disappear, when there is the ego, the Soul will disappear. 
The Soul creates realization, enlightenment, the ego creates ignorance.
We don't care about time or anything either, when we're with a person. Quite special one.

We find our time really amusing, with them. We are enjoying our full.

Intially we take all this easily having no connection at all, but eventually, it get stucked to us. To our heart. To our everything.

Knowing them more and also expressing ourself to them, leads to a pretty great bond between us.

We get addicted to them.

Addiction in the sense like we want more of having talks, spending our time, enjoying and living happily,

That's all, with them.

We don't really care if it will last long. We are getting a pleasure atleast for now.

But when, it's time for us to see they are changing the same way we expected them to be,

It get hurts, somewhere still.

We thought we won't care about things going this way, when it was fine back then.

But now, when things actually started going this way, it affect us.

It still hurts.

We still wanted them to stay, like we wanted those people to stay who meant much to us once yet now they are only being, a memory.

What is one of the worst feelings in the world?

To see we aren't changed yet.

We still care about people and trust them eventhough we have those each and every lessons for not trusting them.

And when this time too, if we're seeing them seprating from us, it hurts again.

We get to know that,

Neither we are used to this pain even after getting so many,

Nor we are even able to change for not having one.

It. Really. Sucks.

When KGF chapter 2 was released my family was about to go theater but we failed to go 😭 as we were going to one of my relatives house.

Though after a big span of time after releasing the movie. I downloaded this movie on my tablet and we're watching it. My cousins were also there so it was a big fun. And we're also connected my tab with a speaker sound box so it was a real feeling of theater.😃😄

It was big fun throughout the movie also with chips and chocolates 😊.

Leaving. Till than handle this (BYE)
